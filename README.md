Useful scripts I use on my machine

packages - If you use pacman as your package manager (Arch-based distro users), will obtain a list of 
all your installed packages as well as their version and dependencies and will output this to a csv file
for easy reading.

subs - uses alass to retime all subtitles in a given folder based on source video of the same name

todo - moves to my todo directory and opens a given file in libreoffice calc

vpn - an openvpn script being worked on

zipdel - unzips all zip/7z files in a folder then deletes all zip/7z files
